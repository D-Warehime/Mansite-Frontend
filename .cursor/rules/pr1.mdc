# Your rule content

- Do Not stop until the task described is finished.
- Write out 2-3 short quick paragraphs describing everything you're about to accomplish (from an overhead perspective if its a lot) all before you start writing any code.
- If possible provide two separate solutions and weigh each one evenly and present them both.
